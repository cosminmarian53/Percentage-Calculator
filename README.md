# !!DISCLAIMER!!
This website is an older project that I add made a while back. Currently, I'm trying to publish all of my old and new projects to Github so that I can easily keep track of them and in case I want to revisit them.

# Percentage Calculator

This lightweight web application calculates the percentage of one number relative to another. It utilizes HTML and JavaScript. This is one of my first projects, which taught me how to use Javascript at a VERY basic level.

## Features

- Calculate what percentage one number represents of another
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- No server dependencies, operates entirely client-side

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the two numbers: the original value and the total value.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The result, expressing the first number as a percentage of the second, will be displayed instantly.
